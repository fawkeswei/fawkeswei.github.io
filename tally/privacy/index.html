        <h1>Privacy Policy for Tally: Counter & Score Tracker</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy explains how Tally: Counter & Score Tracker ("the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Tally is designed to be a simple, privacy-focused counting app. Your counters and their values are stored locally on your device and optionally synced across your devices using iCloud.</p>

        <p>The App collects and uses the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Counter Data:</strong> The counters you create and their values are stored locally on your device. This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your counter data is securely synced across your devices using Apple's iCloud service. This data is encrypted and only accessible to you through your Apple ID.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All counter data is stored locally on your device. If you choose to enable iCloud sync, your data is also stored in your personal iCloud account, encrypted and protected by Apple's security measures. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Tally does not use any third-party analytics or advertising services. The only external service used is Apple's iCloud for optional data synchronization, which is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Optional permission to sync your counters across devices. You can disable this at any time in your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. All data is stored locally on your device or in your encrypted iCloud account. We do not have servers that store your personal data.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is rated 4+ and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The app functions entirely locally or through your personal iCloud account.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all app data at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting individual counters within the app</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app from your device</li>
            <li>Disabling iCloud sync and removing data from iCloud if you've enabled sync</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
