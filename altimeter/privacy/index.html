        <h1>Privacy Policy for Altimeter ∞</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy explains how Altimeter ∞ ("the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Altimeter ∞ is designed with privacy in mind. The app processes location data locally on your device to calculate and display altitude information. This data is used solely for providing altitude measurements and is never transmitted to external servers.</p>

        <p>The App collects and uses the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Used exclusively to determine your current altitude. This data is processed locally on your device and is not stored or transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information may be collected for app functionality and compatibility purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All altitude measurements and location data are processed in real-time on your device. The App does not store historical location data or create a database of your movements. Any preferences or settings you configure are stored locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The free version of Altimeter ∞ may display advertisements through Google AdMob. These services may collect certain information as outlined in their respective privacy policies. The Pro version does not contain any advertisements or third-party tracking.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requires the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Permission:</strong> Required to access GPS data for altitude calculation. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, your location information is never exposed to network transmission risks.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is rated 4+ and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The app's functionality is limited to displaying altitude information based on device location.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
